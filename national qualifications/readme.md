# 🚀 Advanced Astro-Logistics Routing Optimization

This project presents a robust and highly effective solution for a dynamic **astro-logistics routing challenge** on a celestial body. The core objective is to achieve **optimal logistic efficiency** by strategically establishing connectivity between various **Building** structures (active astronaut pads and target modules) using a combination of physical **Tubes** and high-capacity **Teleporters**, all while operating under a strict **resource budget ($R_{current}$)**.

**Achievement Highlight: This sophisticated optimization framework was instrumental in our team's success, earning us qualification for the international competition representing Cameroon.**

## 🧐 The Challenge: Multi-Objective Optimization

The evaluation of any proposed routing configuration is based on a complex, multi-component score designed to capture holistic logistic performance:

1.  **Resource Efficiency (Cost Management):** Minimizing total construction cost.
    * **Tubes:** Cost is calculated based on geographic distance ($geoDist$) plus a fixed setup fee (1000).
    * **Teleporters:** Incur a high, fixed resource deduction (5000).
2.  **Operational Speed (Distance Minimization):** Reducing the path distance (calculated via **BFS/Dijkstra**) between active pads and their assigned target modules.
3.  **Network Resilience (Load Balancing):** Efficiently distributing astronaut load across target modules to prevent localized capacity overruns. Heavy utilization incurs significant penalties.
4.  **Strategic Conservation:** Applying a monthly factor to incentivize and reward the early conservation of resources for future operational flexibility.

## 🛠️ The Solution: Integrated Heuristics and Simulated Annealing

Our approach employs a three-pronged methodology, leveraging graph theory, heuristic generation, and metaheuristic optimization.

### 1. Heuristic Candidate Generation

To constrain the search space efficiently, potential routes are pre-filtered and prioritized based on geometric feasibility and potential impact.

| Route Type | Constraints and Selection Criteria |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tubes (Non-Teleporters)** | **Geometric:** Must not intersect existing non-teleporter routes. **Structural:** Connected buildings must not exceed a degree of 5. **Logistics:** Maximum distance dynamically restricted by expected astronaut volume served. |
| **Teleporters** | Considered for aggressive, high-value connections. Typically selected for large distances (e.g., $>50 \text{km}$ with $5+$ astronauts) or very high required volume (e.g., $30+$ astronauts). |

### 2. Fast Graph-Based Evaluation ($\text{fastEvaluate}$)

The evaluation function simulates the network's performance given an active set of routes:

* **Pathfinding:** Calculates the shortest path between all pads and targets. Non-teleporter routes contribute their $geoDist$ as weight, while teleporters contribute a weight of $0$ to reflect their instantaneous nature.
* **Routing Logic:** Determines the optimal target module for each astronaut based on a balanced metric that penalizes both distance (speed score) and existing/temporary load (balance penalty).

### 3. Optimization via Simulated Annealing (SA)

Given the **NP-hard** nature, the non-linear objective function, and the "rugged" search space (prone to local optima), **Simulated Annealing** was chosen as the primary optimization engine. SA is highly effective for large-scale, discrete optimization problems.

| SA Parameter | Configuration | Detail |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Initialization** | Greedy Solution | An initial state is built by iteratively accepting the highest-priority candidates until the budget is exhausted. |
| **Initial Temperature ($T_{0}$)** | $300.0$ | High initial temperature enables broad, aggressive exploration of the search space. |
| **Cooling Rate ($\alpha$)** | $0.97$ | A slow cooling rate ensures sufficient time for thorough search before convergence. |
| **Limits** | 3000 Iterations / 450 ms | Implemented for guaranteed computational performance and speed. |
| **Neighborhood Search** | Route Flip (1-2 candidates) | Neighbors are generated by flipping the inclusion status (adding/removing) of one random route, with a chance to flip a second route for wider neighborhood exploration. |

#### Acceptance Mechanism

The core of SA is the probabilistic acceptance criteria, which allows the algorithm to move to a worse-scoring solution ($\Delta \text{Score} < 0$) with a probability $P$:

$$P(\text{accept}) = e^{\frac{\Delta \text{Score}}{T}}$$

This mechanism allows the search to escape local optima, leading to a globally superior final configuration as the temperature ($T$) slowly cools.
